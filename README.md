## Getting Started

Here is a quick step by step to get started with our project


### Prerequisities

Fork the repo and clone locally

#### You must node installed and have a MySQL db to connect to
The config file to connect to db is in server->db->config->config.js

#####Example of config layout:
```
module.exports = {
    db_host: 'HOST_IP',
    db_user: 'DB_USER',
    db_password: 'DB_PASSWORD',
    db_name: 'DB_NAME',
    charset: 'utf8',
    secret: 'DB_SECRET',
    clientID: 'CLIENT_ID',
    clientSecret: 'CLIENT SECRET'
  };


```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
